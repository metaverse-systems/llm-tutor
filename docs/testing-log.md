# Diagnostics Quickstart Execution Log

_Date:_ 2025-10-07  
_Operator:_ Automation via GitHub Copilot agent

## Step 1 – Build shared packages

```bash
npm run build --workspaces
```

Outcome: ✅ All workspaces compiled. Desktop bundler emitted `dist/main.js` and `dist/preload.js` artefacts; frontend build completed in 635 ms.

## Step 2 – Start backend in watch mode

```bash
timeout 5 npm run dev --workspace @metaverse-systems/llm-tutor-backend
```

Outcome: ✅ Backend announced `Diagnostics API listening at http://127.0.0.1:4319` before the timeout reclaimed the process (exit code 124 expected from `timeout`).

## Step 3 – Launch frontend dev server

```bash
timeout 5 npm run dev --workspace @metaverse-systems/llm-tutor-frontend
```

Outcome: ✅ Vite reported `Local: http://localhost:5173/`; the command exited after the timeout window.

## Step 4 – Run desktop shell harness

```bash
timeout 15 npm run dev --workspace @metaverse-systems/llm-tutor-desktop
```

Outcome: ⚠️ Electron, backend, bundler, and Vite all spin up. The Electron-managed backend immediately restarted and exited with `EADDRINUSE` because the separate backend watcher (Step 2) still owned port 4319. Manual `npx electron apps/desktop/dist/main.js` succeeds after terminating the duplicate watcher.

## Step 5 – Diagnostics view & accessibility toggles

UI exercised through automated Playwright accessibility suite (see Step 8). Manual keyboard walkthrough not recorded due to headless environment.

## Step 6 – Accessibility controls persistence

Covered by Playwright regression (Step 8). Verified persistence through DOM snapshots—body attributes remain after reload.

## Step 7 – Simulate backend failure

Validated by unit/integration tests and by observing electron dev harness logs when backend watcher is terminated (Electron surfaces `Diagnostics summary request failed: DIAGNOSTICS_NOT_FOUND`).

## Step 8 – Accessibility regression

```bash
npx playwright test tests/accessibility/diagnostics.spec.ts --config apps/frontend/playwright.config.ts
```

Outcome: ✅ Playwright auto-started Vite preview and passed all three accessibility checks. HTML report stored under `docs/reports/playwright/`.

## Step 9 – Export workflow

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS=--import=tsx xvfb-run -a npx playwright test tests/e2e/diagnostics/export.spec.ts
```

Outcome: ✅ Playwright now delegates to the Electron launcher, which guarantees a concrete remote-debugging port. Optional `DEBUG_ELECTRON_LAUNCH=1` and `LLM_TUTOR_DIAGNOSTICS_LOG=1` flags print the resolved port and export summary to stderr. The automation deposits a JSONL export log beside the snapshot (default `${app.getPath("userData")}/diagnostics/exports`).

## Additional Validation

- Vitest across all workspaces: ✅
- Shared schema tests: ✅
- Backend integration retention: ✅
- Renderer hook unit coverage: ✅
- Desktop preload IPC coverage: ✅

## Follow-ups

1. ~~Resolve Playwright/Electron compatibility so the export smoke test can run without manual intervention.~~ Addressed 2025-10-09 via launcher port negotiation and documentation updates.
2. Eliminate double backend boot in the desktop dev harness (consider gating the backend watcher when Electron spawns its managed instance).

Reference: automation workflow, port handling, and export log guidance now captured in `docs/diagnostics.md`.

# Persistence Vault Regression Sweep

_Date:_ 2025-10-08  
_Operator:_ Automation via GitHub Copilot agent

## Step 1 – Vitest across all workspaces

```bash
npm run test --workspaces
```

Outcome: ✅ Backend, desktop, frontend, and shared Vitest suites all passed (31 tests total). Contract and integration coverage confirm the new preference endpoints.

## Step 2 – Rebuild frontend bundle for preview server

```bash
npm run build --workspace @metaverse-systems/llm-tutor-frontend
```

Outcome: ✅ Vite emitted a fresh production bundle so the preview server reflects the storage-alert markup change needed by Playwright.

## Step 3 – Accessibility + persistence regression

```bash
cd apps/frontend
npx playwright test tests/accessibility/diagnostics.spec.ts tests/accessibility/diagnostics-persistence.spec.ts
```

Outcome: ✅ All six scenarios (three accessibility, three persistence) passed after refining the storage-failure locators. Latest HTML report stored under `docs/reports/playwright/`.

## Step 4 – Desktop harness smoke

```bash
timeout 15 npm run dev --workspace @metaverse-systems/llm-tutor-desktop
```

Outcome: ⚠️ Lock-guard confirmed—only the managed backend instance booted—but Electron exited with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` while resolving `packages/shared/dist/diagnostics/preference-record`. Although `dist/diagnostics/preference-record.js` exists, Node’s ESM resolver rejects the extension-less import emitted by TypeScript. Requires follow-up before the harness can complete unattended.

## Additional notes

- Rebuilt shared diagnostics package via `npx tsc -p packages/shared/tsconfig.build.json` prior to the smoke test to refresh emitted artifacts.
- Playwright persistence failure simulation now renders both toast and panel alerts; debug traces attached in the Playwright HTML report.
- Update 2025-10-08: Follow-up #1 below resolved by adding explicit `.js` extensions to shared diagnostics module imports.
- Update 2025-10-08: Follow-up #2 below resolved by adding workspace-level `test:a11y` placeholder scripts and pointing the frontend command at `playwright.config.ts`.

## Follow-ups

1. ~~Adjust shared package emit (or Electron bundler config) so runtime imports include `.js` extensions, unblocking the desktop smoke harness.~~ Resolved 2025-10-08 by adding explicit `.js` extensions to shared diagnostics modules.
2. ~~Restore workspace-level `test:a11y` script or update the root helper to skip packages without that command.~~ Resolved 2025-10-08 by adding placeholder scripts and aligning the frontend Playwright command.

# Automation Validation Sweep

_Date:_ 2025-10-09  
_Operator:_ Automation via GitHub Copilot agent

## Step 1 – Playwright diagnostics export

```bash
DEBUG_ELECTRON_LAUNCH=1 LLM_TUTOR_DIAGNOSTICS_LOG=1 NODE_OPTIONS=--import=tsx xvfb-run -a npx playwright test tests/e2e/diagnostics/export.spec.ts
```

Outcome: ✅ Completed in 92 s under xvfb. Launcher assigned remote debugging port `43100`; stderr includes `[diagnostics-export] remote-debugging-port` telemetry. Exported snapshot and JSONL log stored under `${app.getPath("userData")}/diagnostics/exports/`.

## Step 2 – Vitest across all workspaces

```bash
npm run test --workspaces
```

Outcome: ✅ 31 tests passing (backend, desktop, frontend, shared). Desktop preload suite confirms expectations for empty payload objects.

## Step 3 – Log verification

Reviewed the generated export log: contains `outcome: "success"`, matched snapshot path, and `accessibilityState` reflecting toggles enforced during automation (`highContrast: true`, `reduceMotion: true`).

## Artifacts

- Playwright HTML report and stderr capture archived in `docs/reports/playwright/automation-2025-10-09/`.
- Export JSONL log preserved alongside snapshots for reference.

## Follow-ups

1. Publish a diagnostics validation report for 2025-10-09 under `docs/reports/diagnostics/` (tracked by T021).
2. Re-run the desktop dev harness smoke once backend auto-start coordination is addressed (pending earlier follow-up).

# Diagnostics Quickstart Execution Log

_Date:_ 2025-10-07  
_Operator:_ Automation via GitHub Copilot agent

## Step 1 – Build shared packages

```bash
npm run build --workspaces
```

Outcome: ✅ All workspaces compiled. Desktop bundler emitted `dist/main.js` and `dist/preload.js` artefacts; frontend build completed in 635 ms.

## Step 2 – Start backend in watch mode

```bash
timeout 5 npm run dev --workspace @metaverse-systems/llm-tutor-backend
```

Outcome: ✅ Backend announced `Diagnostics API listening at http://127.0.0.1:4319` before the timeout reclaimed the process (exit code 124 expected from `timeout`).

## Step 3 – Launch frontend dev server

```bash
timeout 5 npm run dev --workspace @metaverse-systems/llm-tutor-frontend
```

Outcome: ✅ Vite reported `Local: http://localhost:5173/`; the command exited after the timeout window.

## Step 4 – Run desktop shell harness

```bash
timeout 15 npm run dev --workspace @metaverse-systems/llm-tutor-desktop
```

Outcome: ⚠️ Electron, backend, bundler, and Vite all spin up. The Electron-managed backend immediately restarted and exited with `EADDRINUSE` because the separate backend watcher (Step 2) still owned port 4319. Manual `npx electron apps/desktop/dist/main.js` succeeds after terminating the duplicate watcher.

## Step 5 – Diagnostics view & accessibility toggles

UI exercised through automated Playwright accessibility suite (see Step 8). Manual keyboard walkthrough not recorded due to headless environment.

## Step 6 – Accessibility controls persistence

Covered by Playwright regression (Step 8). Verified persistence through DOM snapshots—body attributes remain after reload.

## Step 7 – Simulate backend failure

Validated by unit/integration tests and by observing electron dev harness logs when backend watcher is terminated (Electron surfaces `Diagnostics summary request failed: DIAGNOSTICS_NOT_FOUND`).

## Step 8 – Accessibility regression

```bash
npx playwright test tests/accessibility/diagnostics.spec.ts --config apps/frontend/playwright.config.ts
```

Outcome: ✅ Playwright auto-started Vite preview and passed all three accessibility checks. HTML report stored under `docs/reports/playwright/`.

## Step 9 – Export workflow

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS=--import=tsx xvfb-run -a npx playwright test tests/e2e/diagnostics/export.spec.ts
```

Outcome: ⚠️ Playwright’s `_electron.launch` failed because Electron 38 rejects the `--remote-debugging-port=0` flag. Manual export flow (launching via `npx electron apps/desktop/dist/main.js`) works, but a wrapper or Playwright upgrade is required for automated coverage.

## Additional Validation

- Vitest across all workspaces: ✅
- Shared schema tests: ✅
- Backend integration retention: ✅
- Renderer hook unit coverage: ✅
- Desktop preload IPC coverage: ✅

## Follow-ups

1. Resolve Playwright/Electron compatibility so the export smoke test can run without manual intervention.
2. Eliminate double backend boot in the desktop dev harness (consider gating the backend watcher when Electron spawns its managed instance).

# Persistence Vault Regression Sweep

_Date:_ 2025-10-08  
_Operator:_ Automation via GitHub Copilot agent

## Step 1 – Vitest across all workspaces

```bash
npm run test --workspaces
```

Outcome: ✅ Backend, desktop, frontend, and shared Vitest suites all passed (31 tests total). Contract and integration coverage confirm the new preference endpoints.

## Step 2 – Rebuild frontend bundle for preview server

```bash
npm run build --workspace @metaverse-systems/llm-tutor-frontend
```

Outcome: ✅ Vite emitted a fresh production bundle so the preview server reflects the storage-alert markup change needed by Playwright.

## Step 3 – Accessibility + persistence regression

```bash
cd apps/frontend
npx playwright test tests/accessibility/diagnostics.spec.ts tests/accessibility/diagnostics-persistence.spec.ts
```

Outcome: ✅ All six scenarios (three accessibility, three persistence) passed after refining the storage-failure locators. Latest HTML report stored under `docs/reports/playwright/`.

## Step 4 – Desktop harness smoke

```bash
timeout 15 npm run dev --workspace @metaverse-systems/llm-tutor-desktop
```

Outcome: ⚠️ Lock-guard confirmed—only the managed backend instance booted—but Electron exited with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` while resolving `packages/shared/dist/diagnostics/preference-record`. Although `dist/diagnostics/preference-record.js` exists, Node’s ESM resolver rejects the extension-less import emitted by TypeScript. Requires follow-up before the harness can complete unattended.

## Additional notes

- Rebuilt shared diagnostics package via `npx tsc -p packages/shared/tsconfig.build.json` prior to the smoke test to refresh emitted artifacts.
- Playwright persistence failure simulation now renders both toast and panel alerts; debug traces attached in the Playwright HTML report.
- Update 2025-10-08: Follow-up #1 below resolved by adding explicit `.js` extensions to shared diagnostics module imports.
- Update 2025-10-08: Follow-up #2 below resolved by adding workspace-level `test:a11y` placeholder scripts and pointing the frontend command at `playwright.config.ts`.

## Follow-ups

1. ~~Adjust shared package emit (or Electron bundler config) so runtime imports include `.js` extensions, unblocking the desktop smoke harness.~~ Resolved 2025-10-08 by adding explicit `.js` extensions to shared diagnostics modules.
2. ~~Restore workspace-level `test:a11y` script or update the root helper to skip packages without that command.~~ Resolved 2025-10-08 by adding placeholder scripts and aligning the frontend Playwright command.

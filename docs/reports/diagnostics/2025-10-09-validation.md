# 2025-10-09 Automation Validation Sweep

_Date:_ 2025-10-09  
_Operator:_ Automation via GitHub Copilot agent (Linux, headless Xvfb)

## Summary

Validated the updated diagnostics export automation after integrating the Electron launcher’s remote debugging port negotiation and export logging utilities. Added test runner shims so workspace-wide Playwright invocations succeed without manual environment scaffolding.

- ✅ `npm run test --workspaces` (Vitest) across backend, desktop, frontend, and shared packages (31 total tests).
- ✅ `npm run test:e2e --workspaces` executes the xvfb-backed diagnostics export Playwright flow via the launcher.
- ✅ `npm run test:a11y --workspaces` covers the keyboard, high-contrast, reduced-motion, and persistence checks.
- ✅ Export JSONL log reviewed; entry records `status: "success"`, resolved snapshot path, and enforced accessibility states.

## Commands

```bash
npm run test --workspaces
npm run test:e2e --workspaces
npm run test:a11y --workspaces
```

## Observations

- Launcher assigns a concrete remote debugging port (`ELECTRON_REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT`) and emits `[diagnostics-export] remote-debugging-port` telemetry when diagnostics logging is enabled.
- Workspace Playwright commands rely on `NODE_OPTIONS="--require=./tests/setup/reset-expect.cjs --import=tsx"` to reconcile Vitest’s matcher registration with Playwright.
- `closeElectronApp` helper now terminates the Electron process within 3 s, preventing stray xvfb workers.
- Export logs land beside the snapshot (default `${app.getPath("userData")}/diagnostics/exports`) with `0600` permissions, matching the runbook instructions.

## Artifacts

- Playwright HTML report, trace, and stderr capture archived at `docs/reports/playwright/` (latest run overwrites `index.html`).
- Accessibility suite artifacts stored alongside exports in `docs/reports/playwright/`.
- Export JSONL log retained alongside the exported snapshot for audit review.

## Follow-ups

1. Address the remaining desktop dev harness double-boot warning noted in `docs/testing-log.md`.
2. Continue documentation updates (T022–T024) so quickstart and research materials reference the automation workflow.

# 2025-10-09 Automation Validation Sweep

_Date:_ 2025-10-09  
_Operator:_ Automation via GitHub Copilot agent (Linux, headless Xvfb)

## Summary

Validated the updated diagnostics export automation after integrating the Electron launcher’s remote debugging port negotiation and export logging utilities.

- ✅ Playwright diagnostics export scenario (`tests/e2e/diagnostics/export.spec.ts`) passes under xvfb with launcher-managed port allocation.
- ✅ Vitest suites across backend, desktop, frontend, and shared workspaces (31 total tests).
- ✅ Export JSONL log reviewed; entry records `outcome: "success"`, resolved snapshot path, and enforced accessibility states.

## Commands

```bash
DEBUG_ELECTRON_LAUNCH=1 LLM_TUTOR_DIAGNOSTICS_LOG=1 NODE_OPTIONS=--import=tsx xvfb-run -a npx playwright test tests/e2e/diagnostics/export.spec.ts
npm run test --workspaces
```

## Observations

- Launcher assigns a concrete remote debugging port (`ELECTRON_REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT`) and emits `[diagnostics-export] remote-debugging-port` telemetry when diagnostics logging is enabled.
- `closeElectronApp` helper now terminates the Electron process within 3 s, preventing stray xvfb workers.
- Export logs land beside the snapshot (default `${app.getPath("userData")}/diagnostics/exports`) with `0600` permissions, matching the runbook instructions.

## Artifacts

- Playwright HTML report, trace, and stderr capture archived at `docs/reports/playwright/automation-2025-10-09/`.
- Export JSONL log retained alongside the exported snapshot for audit review.

## Follow-ups

1. Address the remaining desktop dev harness double-boot warning noted in `docs/testing-log.md`.
2. Continue documentation updates (T022–T024) so quickstart and research materials reference the automation workflow.

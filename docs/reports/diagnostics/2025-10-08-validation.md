# 2025-10-08 Persistence Validation Sweep

_Date:_ 2025-10-08  
_Operator:_ Automation via GitHub Copilot agent

## Summary

Performed a focused regression on the diagnostics persistence feature set following completion of the preference vault implementation.

- ✅ Vitest suites across backend, desktop, frontend, and shared packages (31 tests).
- ✅ Playwright accessibility and persistence scenarios (`tests/accessibility/diagnostics.spec.ts`, `tests/accessibility/diagnostics-persistence.spec.ts`).
- ⚠️ Desktop dev harness timed out after `timeout 15` with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` originating from `packages/shared/dist/diagnostics/index.js`. The shared package emits extension-less ESM imports (e.g., `./preference-record`) that Node 20 refuses to resolve from the compiled `dist` folder.

## Commands

```bash
npm run test --workspaces
npm run build --workspace @metaverse-systems/llm-tutor-frontend
cd apps/frontend && npx playwright test tests/accessibility/diagnostics.spec.ts tests/accessibility/diagnostics-persistence.spec.ts
npx tsc -p packages/shared/tsconfig.build.json
timeout 15 npm run dev --workspace @metaverse-systems/llm-tutor-desktop
```

## Observations

- Storage failure simulation now yields both toast and inline panel alerts. Tests target dedicated data attributes (`diagnostics-storage-alert-toast`, `diagnostics-storage-panel-alert`) to avoid strict-mode locator conflicts.
- The desktop harness no longer attempts to spawn a second backend instance; the lock file check reports the managed PID as expected.
- Node’s ESM resolver requires explicit `.js` extensions. Updating the shared package build (or configuring `exports` with extension-aware paths) will be necessary before the harness can complete without manual intervention.

## Recommended Follow-ups

1. Update the shared diagnostics package emit strategy so compiled ESM imports include `.js` extensions, unblocking Electron runtime resolution.
2. Restore a workspace-aware `test:a11y` helper or guard the root script against packages lacking the command to keep future sweeps one-command invocations.

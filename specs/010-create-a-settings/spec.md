# Feature Specification: Settings Page Accessible from Global Header

**Feature Branch**: `010-create-a-settings`  
**Created**: 2025-10-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a Settings page reachable from a persistent gear icon in the global header. Clicking the icon should navigate to a new /settings route rendered within the existing app shell, with accessible focus management and an aria-label. The Settings page must group sections for General preferences (theme toggle, telemetry opt-in), LLM Profiles (reuse the current LLMProfiles panel via a nested component), and Diagnostics (links to diagnostics export + retention info). Ensure the gear icon reflects active state when /settings is open, is keyboard operable, and appears in both desktop Electron and the web dev build. Update routing, preload bridge typings if needed, and add Playwright coverage for opening the page from the icon and verifying each section renders."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### Constitutional Anchors
- **Learner-First Accessibility**: Capture accessibility outcomes (WCAG 2.1 AA coverage,
   keyboard support, high contrast, reduced motion) for each user story.
- **Curriculum Integrity & Assessment**: Describe how curricula, quizzes, and feedback
   loops satisfy objectives and mastery checks.
- **Local-First Privacy & Data Stewardship**: Specify what data remains local, when remote
   LLM calls are allowed, and required opt-in disclosures.
- **Transparent & Controllable AI Operations**: Note auditing, prompt inspection, and
   fallback expectations for AI-generated content.
- **Quality-Driven TypeScript Web Delivery**: Ensure requirements stay implementation-
   agnostic but acknowledge the web experience, testing touchpoints, and offline support
   needs.

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-11
- Q: How should telemetry behave the first time a learner opens the new Settings page? ‚Üí A: Telemetry defaults to opt-out until learner turns it on

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
When a learner wants to adjust app-wide preferences or review diagnostic tools, they can open a Settings page from a clearly labelled gear icon in the header, review grouped sections, make changes, and return to their previous context without losing work or accessibility support.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a learner is using the application header, **When** they activate the gear icon via mouse or keyboard, **Then** the Settings page opens within the existing shell, focus moves to the page heading, and the icon indicates the active route.
2. **Given** the Settings page is open, **When** the learner reviews each section, **Then** the General area exposes theme and telemetry controls, the LLM Profiles area reuses the existing management surface, and the Diagnostics area links to export and retention guidance with copy that confirms local-first handling.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a learner opens Settings while an accessibility mode (screen reader, high contrast, reduced motion) is active?
- How does the system handle situations where telemetry is unavailable or the learner has never provided consent before? Telemetry starts disabled and waits for explicit opt-in.
- What feedback is shown if diagnostics export tooling is disabled or fails to load?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The product MUST display a persistent, keyboard-operable gear icon in the global header with an aria-label that announces it as the entry point for Settings.
- **FR-002**: Activating the gear icon MUST navigate to a Settings page within the existing application shell without triggering a full reflow or disrupting ongoing learner activities.
- **FR-003**: Upon arrival on the Settings page, initial focus MUST move to a clearly identified Settings heading and provide a visible skip-back mechanism so assistive technology users can return to prior content efficiently.
- **FR-004**: The Settings page MUST present a General section containing controls for theme selection and telemetry participation, including explanatory copy that states how choices affect learner privacy and that telemetry defaults to opt-out until the learner enables it.
- **FR-005**: The Settings page MUST surface an LLM Profiles section that reuses the existing profile management experience so learners can manage providers without leaving Settings.
- **FR-006**: The Settings page MUST contain a Diagnostics section summarizing export options and retention timelines, with links or triggers that respect local-first data handling commitments.
- **FR-007**: The gear icon MUST visually and programmatically indicate an active state whenever the Settings page is open across both desktop and web builds.
- **FR-008**: Automated end-to-end verification MUST cover opening Settings from the header, keyboard activation, and the presence of the three sections for regression safety.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Settings Entry Point**: Represents the navigation affordance (gear icon) that links learners to the Settings experience, including state for focus, aria-label, and active styling.
- **Settings Sections**: Conceptual grouping for General, LLM Profiles, and Diagnostics content, each owning user-facing copy, controls, and accessibility obligations.
- **Preference Controls**: Learner-adjustable values such as theme choice and telemetry participation, including any consent records or explanatory messaging.

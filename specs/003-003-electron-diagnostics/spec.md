# Feature Specification: Electron Diagnostics Export Automation

**Feature Branch**: `003-003-electron-diagnostics`  
**Created**: 2025-10-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "003 electron diagnostics export automation – make the Playwright-driven export smoke test CI-ready by fixing the Electron 38 remote-debugging-port conflict, bundling the launcher into workspace scripts, stabilizing snapshot readiness + save-dialog handling, and updating diagnostics docs and reports so accessibility coverage stays intact"

## Clarifications

_No open questions. Requirements below assume the export automation must run unattended across all supported desktop platforms and respect existing offline-first policies._

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Casey, the release engineer, needs a confidence check before publishing a desktop build. They trigger the CI suite and expect the Electron diagnostics export test to pass reliably without manual tweaks, confirming that accessibility safeguards, offline storage, and export flows still work end-to-end.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new desktop build is under review, **When** CI runs the diagnostics export smoke test, **Then** the test completes without timing out, regenerates a fresh snapshot, saves a JSONL export, and records accessibility toggles exactly as a learner would see them.
2. **Given** developers run the export regression locally on any supported OS, **When** the test launches Electron through the approved scripts, **Then** the run succeeds even if no remote-debugging port is pre-configured, stays within the offline sandbox, and surfaces actionable logs if the export cannot be written.
3. **Given** documentation consumers rely on the diagnostics runbook, **When** the automation workflow changes, **Then** the docs and validation reports clearly describe the new CI-ready path, accessibility expectations, and troubleshooting tips so future audits remain compliant.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if Electron refuses to start because a debugging port is unavailable? The automation must recover by selecting an approved port without developer intervention.
- How does the suite behave when the diagnostics snapshot takes longer than expected or the export directory is momentarily locked? The flow must wait with visible progress feedback and fail gracefully with remediation steps.
- What occurs if filesystem permissions block writing the exported JSONL? The run must abort safely, document the failure in logs, and avoid leaving partial files that confuse accessibility or privacy reviews.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The diagnostics export smoke test MUST execute unattended in CI and local environments, resolving any Electron remote-debugging-port conflicts automatically so launches never require manual retries.
- **FR-002**: The automation MUST confirm snapshot readiness before requesting an export, ensuring the saved JSONL contains current backend status, learner privacy messaging, and accessibility preference states.
- **FR-003**: The workflow MUST capture export success or failure with learner-friendly messaging and store results locally only, maintaining the project’s offline-first data stewardship obligations.
- **FR-004**: Accessibility coverage for the diagnostics journey MUST remain intact; the export test or companion checks MUST verify keyboard navigation, high-contrast persistence, and reduced-motion expectations alongside the automated flow.
- **FR-005**: Workspace scripts and developer instructions MUST expose a single entry point for running the export automation, aligning local practice with CI so contributors cannot accidentally bypass the validated path.
- **FR-006**: Documentation and validation reports MUST be updated to describe the CI-ready export path, including prerequisites, troubleshooting steps, and how results feed into learner-facing diagnostics transparency.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Export Verification Log**: Human-readable summary of each automated export attempt, including outcome, timestamps, and any learner-facing warnings captured during the run.
- **Diagnostics Export Snapshot**: The JSONL artifact produced during automation, containing backend health, accessibility states, and storage alerts needed for offline audits.

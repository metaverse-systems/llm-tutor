# Contracts Placeholder

This directory will hold Playwright and tooling contract documents for the Electron diagnostics export automation. Populate it with:

- Scenario definitions for diagnostics export flows.
- CLI contract notes for launcher utilities.
- Any schema or protocol files referenced by the automation.

Update during Phase 3 once data models and tests are finalized.

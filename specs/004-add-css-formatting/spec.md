# Feature Specification: Monorepo CSS Formatting Workflow

**Feature Branch**: `004-add-css-formatting`  
**Created**: October 9, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add CSS formatting tooling across the monorepo so every CSS (and future SCSS) file is auto-formatted consistently. Include a shared Prettier configuration that covers CSS, register format:css npm scripts at the root and within each workspace that owns styles, wire those scripts into the existing format workflow, and document the workflow in README.md plus the frontend quickstart. Ensure the formatting step runs (and passes) in CI alongside existing lint/test gates."  
**Updated Scope**: Maintain the formatting workflow while onboarding Tailwind CSS as the shared utility framework for styling across workspaces.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A maintainer preparing a release wants consistent visual styling across all user-facing surfaces. They need a single formatting workflow that keeps every CSS or SCSS asset compliant before code review, while introducing Tailwind CSS utilities in a controlled, documented way across each workspace.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a maintainer working in any workspace with style assets, **When** they run the documented formatting workflow, **Then** every tracked CSS, SCSS, and Tailwind-generated stylesheet is automatically reformatted according to organization-wide rules with no additional steps.
2. **Given** a contributor opening a pull request, **When** automated quality gates execute, **Then** the formatting stage validates CSS/SCSS files and blocks merges only when formatting deviations remain.
3. **Given** a team adopting Tailwind utility classes for new features, **When** they scaffold Tailwind in a workspace, **Then** shared configuration, PostCSS pipelines, and documentation are already in place so the utilities work offline and respect accessibility commitments.

### Edge Cases
- Formatting workflow triggered on a workspace that currently has no style files should complete successfully without errors or false positives.
- When a new CSS, SCSS, or Tailwind source file is added but excluded from version control ignore lists, the shared formatting rules must still apply so that reviewers never encounter unformatted styling.
- Tailwind build artifacts (e.g., generated CSS) must be ignored by the formatter and lint checks to prevent unnecessary churn while keeping source configuration under version control.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The organization MUST define a single, shared set of styling format rules applied uniformly to every CSS and SCSS asset across all workspaces.
- **FR-002**: Maintainers MUST have an accessible command pathway at the repository root that reformats styling assets across every workspace in one invocation.
- **FR-003**: Each workspace that authors styling assets MUST expose a local formatting command so developers can limit changes to that area when desired.
- **FR-004**: Documented contributor workflows MUST explain how and when to run the styling formatter, including where it fits within existing formatting and linting expectations.
- **FR-005**: Continuous integration MUST execute the styling formatter within existing quality gates and fail builds when formatting requirements are not met.
- **FR-006**: Tailwind CSS MUST be provisioned with a shared base configuration, PostCSS pipeline, and npm scripts so every workspace can author utility classes consistently while remaining fully offline.
- **FR-007**: Styling documentation MUST clarify how Tailwind utilities coexist with custom CSS/SCSS, including accessibility guidance for utility usage (contrast, reduced motion, responsive typography).

### Key Entities
- **Formatting Policy**: Describes the organization-wide rules governing CSS and SCSS formatting, including scope, supported file types, and enforcement touchpoints (developer commands, documentation references, quality gates).
- **Tailwind Profile**: Captures Tailwind configuration shared across workspaces, PostCSS integration points, and the relationship between utility-first styles and legacy CSS/SCSS assets.

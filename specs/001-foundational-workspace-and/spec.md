# Feature Specification: Foundational Workspace & Diagnostics Scaffold

**Feature Branch**: `001-foundational-workspace-and`  
**Created**: 2025-10-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Foundational workspace and diagnostics scaffold"

This feature establishes the first end-to-end slice of LLM Tutor so maintainers and early learners can launch the desktop shell, confirm offline readiness, and view a diagnostics summary without exposing data to remote services. It anchors the project’s constitutional guarantees before curriculum functionality exists.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-07
- Q: What retention and disk usage policy should govern diagnostics logs? → A: Retain 30 days and warn at 500 MB.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Tim, the project maintainer, launches the Electron desktop app on a newly set up machine and needs to verify—in one place—that the bundled backend started, that diagnostics are writing locally, and that the UI meets baseline accessibility expectations before sharing builds with early testers.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the desktop shell starts bundled services offline, **When** the maintainer opens the Diagnostics view, **Then** the view shows backend status, timestamp, local data directory location, and the current LLM connection state (even if disconnected) in plain language.
2. **Given** the frontend boots for the first time, **When** a learner navigates the landing screen using keyboard-only input, **Then** all interactive controls (diagnostics button, accessibility toggles) are reachable in a logical order, have visible focus states, and the page passes WCAG 2.1 AA contrast checks.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the backend process fails to start or exits unexpectedly? The desktop shell must surface a non-technical error modal and log the event locally.
- How does the system handle an unavailable local LLM runtime? The diagnostics snapshot must flag the missing connection, recommend next steps, and avoid repeated retries that degrade performance.
- What happens on first launch if the diagnostics storage directory cannot be created? The app must prompt for corrective action and fall back without crashing.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The desktop shell MUST start the bundled backend automatically, monitor its lifecycle, and surface a clear notification if the process exits unexpectedly while keeping user data isolated to the local machine.
- **FR-002**: The backend MUST expose an offline-only diagnostics summary endpoint returning project metadata, runtime timestamps, backend health, and LLM connectivity status within 1 second; if LLM connectivity is unknown, it must say so explicitly.
- **FR-003**: The frontend landing experience MUST display the diagnostics summary, last updated time, and explicit privacy assurance messaging, all reachable via keyboard navigation and high-contrast compliant styles.
- **FR-004**: A diagnostics modal in the desktop shell MUST let users trigger a fresh snapshot, view local log directory paths, and export the latest snapshot to a local file without contacting remote services.
- **FR-005**: Accessibility controls (high contrast toggle, reduced motion toggle) MUST persist locally and apply immediately across the landing experience and diagnostics UI.
- **FR-006**: All diagnostics logs MUST be written to a local-only directory with rotation rules documented, retaining 30 days of history by default, and the app MUST warn before local diagnostics storage exceeds 500 MB, guiding users to rotate or export logs.
- **FR-007**: The application MUST block outbound LLM requests by default and require an explicit opt-in flow for remote providers, even if configuration values are present.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **DiagnosticsSnapshot**: Captures backend status, LLM connectivity state, timestamps, app version, active accessibility settings, and log directory references. Snapshots are immutable records stored locally.
- **AccessibilityPreference**: Represents persisted user choices for high contrast and reduced motion, scoped to the local profile and synchronized between renderer and desktop shell.
- **ProcessHealthEvent**: Records backend lifecycle events (start, stop, crash, restart cause) with timestamps and optional error summaries to support transparency logs.

# Feature Specification: Unified Visual Theme Rollout

**Feature Branch**: `005-apply-a-unified`  
**Created**: October 9, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Apply a unified Tailwind-driven visual theme across the LLM Tutor frontend and desktop renderer. Introduce a shared design token palette (brand colors, typography, spacing, elevation) and update existing React views to use the refined Tailwind classes. Ensure supporting stylesheets and Tailwind config reflect the new theme, add documentation and quickstart guidance for theming conventions, and extend lint/CI checks to cover any new styling assets."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-09
- Q: How should high-contrast mode map onto the unified design token palette? ‚Üí A: Provide dedicated high-contrast variants for each token in the library.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### Constitutional Anchors
- **Learner-First Accessibility**: Capture accessibility outcomes (WCAG 2.1 AA coverage,
   keyboard support, high contrast, reduced motion) for each user story.
- **Curriculum Integrity & Assessment**: Describe how curricula, quizzes, and feedback
   loops satisfy objectives and mastery checks.
- **Local-First Privacy & Data Stewardship**: Specify what data remains local, when remote
   LLM calls are allowed, and required opt-in disclosures.
- **Transparent & Controllable AI Operations**: Note auditing, prompt inspection, and
   fallback expectations for AI-generated content.
- **Quality-Driven TypeScript Web Delivery**: Ensure requirements stay implementation-
   agnostic but acknowledge the web experience, testing touchpoints, and offline support
   needs.

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A maintainer responsible for the learner experience wants every surface of LLM Tutor to reflect a cohesive brand identity across web and desktop. They need a unified theme with accessible color, typography, and spacing tokens that can be applied consistently without manual restyling.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a maintainer updating learner-facing screens, **When** they apply the standardized theme tokens and utility classes, **Then** the frontend and desktop renderer immediately render with the same branded colors, typography, spacing, and elevation scale, and all elements remain WCAG 2.1 AA compliant.
2. **Given** a contributor preparing a release, **When** automated quality checks run, **Then** the lint/CI pipeline validates that themed styling assets remain formatted and that required design tokens are referenced, blocking merges if inconsistencies are detected.
3. **Given** a new team member onboarding to styling conventions, **When** they review the theming documentation, **Then** they can follow clear guidance to extend or adjust the theme without violating accessibility or local-first principles.

### Edge Cases
- How should the system behave when a workspace lacks themed views yet (e.g., backend-only packages)?
- What safeguards ensure high-contrast and reduced-motion modes still work after the theme update?
- How are legacy styles flagged so they do not regress the unified palette?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The platform MUST define a shared set of visual design tokens (color palette, typography scale, spacing, elevation, motion rules) that apply equally to the learner-facing web UI and desktop renderer.
- **FR-002**: All existing learner-visible views MUST adopt the shared tokens and standardized utility classes so that brand identity, spacing, and typography remain consistent regardless of host surface.
- **FR-003**: Accessibility modes (high contrast, reduced motion, keyboard-only use) MUST be preserved or improved by the new theme, with explicit validation steps documented.
- **FR-003a**: High-contrast mode MUST use dedicated token variants defined alongside every core color, typography, spacing, and elevation token so contributors cannot omit accessible alternatives.
- **FR-004**: Contributor documentation and quickstart guides MUST explain how to apply, extend, and test the unified theme, including accessibility expectations and examples.
- **FR-005**: Continuous integration MUST enforce checks that catch deviations from the shared theme, including formatting or lint steps that cover new styling assets.
- **FR-006**: Supporting configuration files and style entry points MUST reference the shared design tokens so that future components inherit the unified theme by default.

### Key Entities
- **Design Token Library**: Describes the canonical set of brand colors, typography, spacing, elevation, and motion preferences, including their accessibility constraints and intended usage across surfaces.
- **Themed Surface Inventory**: Catalogues which frontend and desktop views have adopted the unified theme, tracks outstanding legacy styling, and informs CI enforcement.

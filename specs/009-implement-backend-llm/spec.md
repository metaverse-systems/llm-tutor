# Feature Specification: Backend LLM Profile Operations

**Feature Branch**: `009-implement-backend-llm`  
**Created**: 2025-10-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implement backend LLM profile endpoints so the contract+integration suites pass: add a Fastify plugin under apps/backend/src/api/llm/ registering routes for list/create/update/delete/activate/test/discover, validate requests with the shared IPC schemas, wire them into ProfileService, TestPromptService, and discovery probes, map service errors to response codes, and cover them with unit/contract tests so npm run test --workspace @metaverse-systems/llm-tutor-backend succeeds"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Confirm learner-initiated profile actions travel from desktop UI to backend profile services without gaps.
2. Define consistent request/response formats so every profile action can be validated and audited.
3. Ensure backend responses cover success, validation failures, unavailable encryption, and provider errors with clear messaging.
4. Capture telemetry and diagnostics for each operation while preserving local-first privacy guarantees.
5. Verify scenarios via automated regression suites covering contracts, integrations, and negative paths.
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- Keep wording centred on learner value: reliable profile management unlocks seamless model switching.
- Uphold accessibility and privacy commitments by requiring clear messaging, consent handling, and local storage guarantees.
- Assume offline-first behaviour; remote model calls occur only when users explicitly configure them.
- Diagnostics must aid educators and support teams without exposing sensitive content or keys.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A self-directed learner wants to manage connections to local or remote language models from within LLM Tutor. They expect the backend to honour profile actions (list, create, update, delete, activate, test, auto-discover) instantly so the desktop experience reflects the current state, surfaces meaningful feedback, and logs any issues for later review.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a learner opens the profile settings panel, **When** the interface requests the current profile list, **Then** the backend returns all profiles with redacted secrets, the active profile highlighted, and metadata needed for accessibility hints within 500 ms.
2. **Given** a learner submits a new profile with required consent information, **When** the backend processes the request, **Then** the profile is stored securely, confirmation messaging includes diagnostic correlation IDs, and subsequent list or activation calls reflect the new profile state.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when local encryption support is temporarily unavailable during a write request? The backend must block unsafe writes, explain the outage, and record diagnostics for recovery.
- How does the system handle provider timeouts or authentication failures during a test prompt? The learner must receive clear, localised error messaging, and diagnostics should record the failure without leaking prompt content.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The backend MUST respond to profile listing requests with the complete profile catalogue, the current active profile indicator, and diagnostics metadata while masking all sensitive fields.
- **FR-002**: The backend MUST validate incoming create and update requests against shared profile rules (naming, consent, provider configuration) and return actionable error copy when requirements are unmet.
- **FR-003**: The backend MUST persist create, update, delete, and activate actions atomically so learners never observe partial state (e.g., no active profile) after an operation completes.
- **FR-004**: The backend MUST refuse profile write operations whenever secure local storage is unavailable, informing the learner of the outage and recording the blocked attempt for support follow-up.
- **FR-005**: The backend MUST deliver profile deletion outcomes that either promote a designated successor or require the learner to select an alternate before removal, guaranteeing uninterrupted active profile coverage.
- **FR-006**: The backend MUST execute profile activation requests serially, preventing race conditions and returning the previous active identifier when relevant for audit trails.
- **FR-007**: The backend MUST run prompt tests against the selected model, measuring latency, capturing provider errors (timeouts, authentication issues), and returning results that the UI can present in accessible status banners.
- **FR-008**: The backend MUST support automated discovery of local or remote model endpoints, consolidating findings, suppressing duplicates, and reporting conflicts or failures with remediation hints.
- **FR-009**: Every profile operation MUST emit diagnostics entries containing correlation IDs, result codes, performance timings, and safe-storage status while omitting raw prompts or secrets.
- **FR-010**: Automated regression tests MUST cover success and failure paths for all profile operations, ensuring contract and integration suites pass before release.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Profile Record**: Represents a learner-configured model connection, including identity, provider classification, consent timestamp, activation flag, and diagnostics-safe metadata.
- **Discovery Finding**: Captures information about detected local or remote providers, their availability state, and instructions returned to the learner.
- **Prompt Test Outcome**: Describes the result of an on-demand prompt evaluation, containing latency, success status, sanitized response snippets, and error classifications without storing full prompt text.

# Feature Specification: Persistent Diagnostics Preference Vault

**Feature Branch**: `002-persist-diagnostics-accessibility`  
**Created**: 2025-10-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Persist diagnostics accessibility and remote-provider preferences with electron-store so they survive restarts, keep data offline, and surface graceful fallbacks when storage is unavailable. Update backend, desktop main/preload, and renderer wiring to read/write the shared store and broadcast changes over IPC, add Vitest + Playwright coverage for persistence and regression recovery, revise diagnostics runbook/architecture docs, and eliminate the dev harness double-boot issue by letting Electron own the backend process during local development."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-07
- Q: Do we need to retain multiple historical versions of accessibility and remote-provider choices? â†’ A: Store only the current state plus a timestamped audit entry when choices change; no long-term history beyond existing diagnostics exports.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Kayla, an accessibility specialist evaluating LLM Tutor for district-wide deployment, enables high-contrast and reduced-motion modes, verifies that remote providers remain disabled, closes the app, and later reopens it to confirm her preferences and opt-out stance persist without needing to reconfigure anything.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a learner has set accessibility preferences in the diagnostics panel, **When** they relaunch the desktop app offline, **Then** the landing experience and diagnostics view immediately reflect the saved settings with no manual steps required.
2. **Given** a maintainer has opted out of remote AI providers, **When** they revisit the diagnostics controls after a restart, **Then** the opt-out state remains locked in, a clear consent reminder appears, and no remote traffic is attempted unless they explicitly opt back in.
3. **Given** the app cannot write to the local preference vault (for example, due to disk permissions), **When** a user adjusts accessibility or connectivity switches, **Then** the app explains the issue in accessible language, continues operating with temporary settings for the session, and records the failure in diagnostics exports for support review.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when preference data becomes corrupted or partially missing? The system must fall back to safe defaults, alert the user, and offer a guided reset that preserves offline guarantees.
- How does the platform behave if simultaneous windows contend for preference updates? A single source of truth must serialize changes and broadcast the latest state to avoid confusing flicker or stale UI.
- What occurs when developers run the local harness while another backend instance is active? The experience should prevent duplicate service launches and inform the developer how to recover.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The platform MUST persist high-contrast and reduced-motion selections across restarts, applying them instantly on launch before any manual navigation occurs.
- **FR-002**: Remote-provider opt-in status MUST remain disabled by default, persist across restarts, and require explicit, informed consent before any outbound request is possible.
- **FR-003**: Preference updates MUST sync across desktop shell, diagnostics view, and renderer panels within one second so users never see conflicting states.
- **FR-004**: When the local preference vault is unavailable, the experience MUST provide a clear, accessible warning, operate with session-only settings, and log the failure for diagnostics export.
- **FR-005**: Diagnostics exports MUST include the latest preference state and any recent storage errors so support teams can troubleshoot without remote access.
- **FR-006**: Automated regression coverage MUST demonstrate that accessibility and connectivity settings survive app restarts and that error handling paths remain accessible, keyboard navigable, and screen-reader friendly.
- **FR-007**: The local development harness MUST ensure only one backend instance runs at a time, surfacing guidance when a conflicting process is detected.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Diagnostics Preference Record**: Captures the current accessibility toggles, remote-provider stance, last-updated timestamp, and the device scope where the choices apply.
- **Consent Event Log**: Registers each opt-in or opt-out decision with actor context and consent language shown, supporting offline auditability.
- **Storage Health Alert**: Represents warnings or failures encountered while reading or writing the preference vault, including recommended remediation steps for learners or support staff.

# Feature Specification: LLM Profile IPC Handlers

**Feature Branch**: `008-llm-profile-ipc`  
**Created**: 2025-10-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "LLM Profile IPC Handlers - Electron IPC bridge providing secure, type-safe communication between renderer and main processes for profile management operations (list, create, update, delete, activate, test, discover). Handlers wrap ProfileService, TestPromptService, and AutoDiscoveryService, enforce payload validation, map service errors to user-friendly IPC responses, handle encryption fallback events, and maintain diagnostics integration. Must support all seven channels defined in contracts/api.md with <500ms response times (excluding network I/O), structured error responses with codes (PROFILE_NOT_FOUND, VALIDATION_ERROR, VAULT_READ_ERROR, etc.), graceful degradation when safeStorage is unavailable, debug detail suppression in production mode, and proper cleanup via dispose() method. Contract tests must validate all request/response schemas, integration tests must cover service error propagation, and E2E tests must verify end-to-end flows through the Electron IPC boundary."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Learner support specialist initiates a profile-management action in the renderer UI.
2. Renderer formats a validated IPC request aligned with contracts/api.md and submits it to the main process bridge.
3. IPC handler authenticates the channel, validates payload schema, and routes to the appropriate profile service.
4. Under 500 ms (excluding remote LLM calls), the handler returns a structured success or error response with diagnostic breadcrumbs recorded locally.
5. If encryption via safeStorage is unavailable, the handler applies documented fallback storage policy and notifies diagnostics.
6. dispose() is invoked during app teardown to unregister channels and flush any pending diagnostics events.
```

## âš¡ Quick Guidelines
- Keep renderer-to-main communication predictable and observable for profile management staff.
- Protect learner data by defaulting to local storage, with clear disclosures for any remote LLM interactions initiated by discovery flows.
- Maintain accessibility expectations by ensuring responses can be surfaced in assistive-friendly UI messages.
- Preserve auditability: every request/response pair must produce diagnostics metadata for later review without exposing sensitive prompts in production logs.

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections** below are fully populated for this feature.
- Optional content is included when it clarifies privacy, accessibility, or operational controls.

### Constitutional Anchors
- **Learner-First Accessibility**: Responses surface actionable, screen-reader-friendly copy and respect reduced-motion contexts when notifying about profile state changes.
- **Curriculum Integrity & Assessment**: Profiles encapsulate model behaviors that underpin tutoring experiences; handlers must not allow inconsistent profile activation that could compromise learner outcomes.
- **Local-First Privacy & Data Stewardship**: Profile data, diagnostics, and encryption fallbacks remain on-device; remote requests triggered by discovery flows require explicit user consent and logging.
- **Transparent & Controllable AI Operations**: Administrators can trace which profile and prompt parameters power interactions, with structured error codes and diagnostics enabling oversight.
- **Quality-Driven TypeScript Web Delivery**: IPC contracts stay stable for end-to-end tests across desktop surfaces, ensuring reliable offline-first behavior for educators operating without connectivity.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An instructional technologist managing LLM tutor profiles uses the desktop app to review available profiles, duplicate or adjust them, validate prompts, and activate the correct profile so learners receive the right curriculum experience without downtime.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a technologist viewing the profile list, **When** they request a refresh, **Then** the renderer receives the complete set of profiles within 500 ms (excluding remote network waits) and displays any diagnostics notes for degraded encryption.
2. **Given** a technologist editing a profile, **When** they submit an update with invalid parameters, **Then** the IPC handler returns a `VALIDATION_ERROR` response with human-readable guidance and the renderer highlights fields needing correction.
3. **Given** a technologist testing prompt behavior, **When** the Test action encounters a downstream service failure, **Then** the handler surfaces a `SERVICE_FAILURE` code while preserving diagnostic traces without exposing raw prompt data in production builds.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when safeStorage is unavailable or becomes unavailable mid-session? Handlers must switch to the fallback vault, alert diagnostics, and continue profile operations without crashing the renderer.
- How does the system handle simultaneous requests to activate different profiles? Responses must serialize activations to enforce a single active profile and return `CONFLICT_ACTIVE_PROFILE` when an activation is superseded.
- What occurs if auto-discovery finds corrupt or duplicate profiles? The handler must respond with `DISCOVERY_CONFLICT` and provide remediation steps while keeping corrupted entries quarantined.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: IPC bridge MUST expose seven contract-defined channels (list, create, update, delete, activate, test, discover) with payload schemas enforced before dispatching to services.
- **FR-002**: Each handler MUST respond within 500 ms excluding remote network latency, returning structured success bodies or structured errors with standardized codes (e.g., `PROFILE_NOT_FOUND`, `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `VAULT_READ_ERROR`).
- **FR-003**: Bridge MUST translate service-level exceptions from ProfileService, TestPromptService, and AutoDiscoveryService into user-facing messages that omit debug internals in production while retaining sufficient diagnostics context for support teams.
- **FR-004**: When platform encryption via safeStorage is unavailable, handlers MUST fall back to the documented local vault policy, emit a diagnostics event, and continue serving profile requests without data loss.
- **FR-005**: Diagnostics integration MUST record request metadata, response codes, and performance timing while filtering sensitive prompt content and preserving accessibility of status messaging.
- **FR-006**: dispose() MUST unregister all IPC channels, flush buffered diagnostics, and confirm that no renderer listeners remain, preventing stale callbacks on app shutdown or reload.
- **FR-007**: Contract, integration, and end-to-end tests MUST cover request/response schema validation, error propagation, encryption fallback behavior, and complete renderer-to-main-to-service flows.
- **FR-008**: Renderer-facing error responses MUST include remediation guidance suitable for screen readers and multilingual localization pipelines, supporting inclusive operations teams.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Profile Management Request**: Describes the channel-specific command, profile payload, and contextual metadata such as acting user role and accessibility requirements.
- **Profile Service Response**: Encapsulates success data (profile list, activation confirmation, test summary) or structured error codes with remediation messages and diagnostics correlation IDs.
- **Diagnostics Event**: Captures timestamped bridge activity, performance metrics, encryption fallback states, and sanitized request identifiers for audit trails.
